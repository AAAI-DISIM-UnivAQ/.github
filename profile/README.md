# AAAI-DISIM-UnivAQ Organization in GitHub
This organization is coordinated by myself [(giodegas)](https://github.com/giodegas) including current active student members of the "Intelligent Systems & Robotics Laboratory" at the

[Dipartimento di Ingegneria e Scienze dell'Informazione e Matematica](https://www.disim.univaq.it) , 

[Università degli Studi dell'Aquila, Italy](https://www.univaq.it)

Our study and research interests are:

* cognitive robotics
* large language models
* multi-agent systems
* computational logic
* machine learning
* knowledge representation
* computer vision

Our students have to design, implement and validate working prototypes in cognitive robotics and/or multi-agent systems in our lab in order to pass the exam.
